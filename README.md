# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Data Structures and Tech Stack Used->>>>>>

Data Structures
Arrays:
Used for maintaining ordered collections, such as storing lists of font sizes or formatting options. Arrays provide efficient indexing and iteration, making them ideal for rendering dropdown menus and managing tool options.
Objects:
Used to store and manage state, like user preferences, selected styles, and configurations for text formatting. Objects offer quick key-value access, making it easy to update and retrieve specific settings dynamically.
State Management (React State):
React's built-in state management is utilized to handle UI interactions (e.g., button clicks for styling, dropdown changes). This ensures a seamless user experience with real-time updates to styles and text properties.
CSS Classes (Atomic Classes):
Leveraged for defining UI styles and layouts with a scalable and reusable approach. Utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS simplify applying consistent and responsive design rules.
Tech Stack
React:
Used for building a dynamic, interactive user interface. React's component-based structure makes it easy to manage reusable UI elements and ensure a clean separation of concerns.
Tailwind CSS:
Chosen for its utility-first approach to styling. It allows rapid UI development with pre-defined classes, ensuring consistent spacing, alignment, and responsiveness.
Heroicons/React-Icons:
Icons provide visual clarity for actions (e.g., bold, italic, align). These libraries integrate well with React and offer customizable, scalable vector icons.
JavaScript:
The core logic for applying styles, managing state, and handling user interactions is implemented in JavaScript. Its versatility and extensive ecosystem make it a natural choice for web-based applications.
Vite (or Create React App):
A fast development server and bundler used to set up and run the project efficiently. Its lightweight configuration ensures rapid builds and reloads during development.
Why These Choices?
React: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in creating a component-based architecture, which improves maintainability and scalability.
Tailwind CSS:
Provides a utility-first approach, eliminating the need for writing repetitive custom CSS and ensuring a consistent design system.
React Icons:
Easily integrates with React and provides a wide variety of icons, reducing the need for custom SVG assets.
Simple Data Structures (Arrays, Objects):
These provide the necessary efficiency and simplicity for the projectâ€™s requirements, ensuring that the code remains lightweight and performant.
